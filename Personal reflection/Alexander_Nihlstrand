What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
The agile process, how to divide work up properly, further knowledge about javascript and webdevelopment.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
During this initial sprint, focus has been on getting to know javascript and web development. During upcoming sprints i hope to apply this knowledge to further develop our program. I also hope to assist the group through valuable discussion and personal input and thought on how to proceed further. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
