1	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I still want to learn more about Scrum. Up until now I have mainly focused on developing the application, so hopefully I will try to take on another role with more focus on the process rather than technical stuff.

2	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

I missed the first group meeting but I was a part of the user story named "6.1 As a cyclist who likes to plan ahead, I want to use a search bar to enter an address and see the nearest stations from there so that I can plan ahead for different locations". It was quite a bit to handle but we got it to work on the last day of the sprint. 

3	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    
I feel like I have improved my technical skills a lot during these 3 sprints. I also think that I see more clearly how breaking down development to user stories and tasks helps creating software.
