	1	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I want to understand more of how the scrum way of working works when the fundamental parts of the app are built. I think I have a clear idea of how all the user stories and planning and so on helps with the early and middle stages of an application but I am curious how it works when theres a lot of small things left to fix. Those small things that are at high risk of being forgotten from my past expriences.
	2	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I want to be more flexible when it comes to what part of the app I am helping with. I want to be able to switch to another task if it is more urgent, rather than fininshing what I am doing completely and then helping.
	3	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    Our sprint planning wasnt the best so therefore the workload was quiet uneven throughout the user stories we said out to get done. So there wasnt much improvements necessaraly from the last sprint other than that we now have a more clear sprint plan ahead.
