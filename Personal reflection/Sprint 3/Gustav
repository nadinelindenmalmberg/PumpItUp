What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Continue same as last week. Further knowledge about the agile process, further knowledge in back-end development.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
During the third sprint, focus has been on getting more comfortable with javascript and web development. This is something that probably will be iterative and recur in most future sprints.

This weeks sprint my contributions have been on the lower end. First I tried to implement to the search bar funcitionality on my own, but to no avail. Later in the week i collaborated in the mini flex group where I took an assisting role in the back end development of the search bar. I also overlooked on some smart functions that came with the API we downloaded that could be integrated in our program 


Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have been able to apply some of my knowledge previously learned from the last sprint. It was very cool to both get an look in the back end and front end to see how everything is connected.
