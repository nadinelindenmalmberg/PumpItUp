What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
- Same as last week even though my understanding has improved. When it comes to scrum and agile processes, I've noticed that many tasks tend to be interdependent, which can make it challenging to work on multiple tasks simultaneously. It would be interesting to explore strategies for working around these dependencies and finding ways to optimize our workflow.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- My primary focus has been on testing our location function and improving the frontend to enhance user-friendliness and coherence. Specifically,my work ensured that users could see their live location while moving around and that the frontend design was easy to navigate and understand. Looking ahead to the next sprint, I believe that our team could benefit from clearer communication and task prioritization.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
- While we have improved our work with scrum and user stories, I've found that it can be difficult to know which tasks each team member is working on when signing on to several tasks. This lack of visibility can hinder our ability to collaborate effectively and complete tasks efficiently. However regarding communication, no incidents related to miscommunication or planning for meetings as accured this week. So we have seen improvements in these areas.
