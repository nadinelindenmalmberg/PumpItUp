What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Similar to last week, I want to continue improving my understanding of testing React applications.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
In terms of my contribution to the team's deliveries, I have been actively working on improving
our testing practices. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
During this third week of the sprint, I was able to apply some of the testing concepts I learned
in the previous week to improve our testing suite.
