What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I will continue with the same as last week because this weeks' work did not give me that much develop in my knowledge of the agile components. 
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This week I need to get in better focus and we need to clearify the plan and devide the work for each member. 
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
The communcation in the team was better this week.
