1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I want to continue to learn about the technical parts of the projects. How to develop an web-application. 

2.	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

During the sprint I have added a feature the lets a user toggle on and off its location in the map that is shown in our application. For the next sprint I plan on fixing some issues that is related to the software and be better at being updated of what the others team-members are doing.

3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have an better understanding of the program we are building and how all the components are working.
