What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Have the knowledge needed, now i will focus on solving bugs

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
During the fifth sprint. The work has been focused on fixing bugs in the application and polish the search results. I also hope to assist the group through valuable discussion and personal input and thought on how to proceed further. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Have focused on bugs rather than new implementation
