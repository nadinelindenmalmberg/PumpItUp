What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
This week resulted in the opposite compared to last week. We were more productive during the meetings. I have got the point about the factors in the agile proceess, teamwork and so on. 
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Now we just have some smaller fixes in the application so the focus is to help the team with them so that we can close our scrum board with all the cards under the done-column.  
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I think the delegation of work came automaticly and the team was agreed to get this project finished.
