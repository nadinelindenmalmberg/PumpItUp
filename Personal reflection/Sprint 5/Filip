What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
How to finalize a product and be happy with it when it is done.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
In terms of my contribution to the team's deliveries, I continued on finishing the tests and added small features, like buttons and stuff. I will try to help to get things done next week.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Over the past week, I finally worked out the problems with testing.
