What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
The last sprint i want to learn how to finalize a project. To see what all the work we have done will come to in the end.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
This weeks sprint has mainly been focused on css and connecting the backend with frontend. The 3 locations that pop up after chosing an adress is now nicely presented in three big buttons in the bottom of the screen. Whats ledft to do is to connect the functionality for the buttons and get the route from your location to the station selected. This week ive continued to work with alexander. We are starting to be a really good coding team. In the upcoming sprint, I aim to contribute to the team by actively participating in meaningful discussions and providing valuable insights to help guide our further progress.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Ive continued to work more problem solvent. Ive started to leave really easy tasks from the end of a sprint to start with on another. This way I get confident and started more quickly and reduce the risk of getting stuck at the beginning of a sprint by getting overwhelmed with tasks.
