What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
- In terms of recent sprints, our team has demonstrated proficiency in teamwork, managing the Scrum board, and implementing agile processes. However, I believe we could benefit from further understanding code organization and structure. As multiple team members contribute to the code, it can sometimes become challenging to maintain clarity and prevent it from becoming messy. So strategies for effectively dividing and organizing code would be something to learn. This would make it easier to locate specific components or functionality within the codebase.
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
- In terms of contributing to the team's deliveries, I have primarily focused on frontend tasks. Looking ahead to the next sprint, our main objectives will be to finalize the product and prepare the final report.
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
- In terms of teamwork and agility, I am pleased to note that our group has continued to excel and collaborate effectively.
