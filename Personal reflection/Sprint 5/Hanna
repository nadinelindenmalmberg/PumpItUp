1	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Now as we are getting close to the end I am exited to see how things wrap up at the end of the project. I am also looking forward to reflecting back on the project and seeing how the agile method has helped this project forward.

	2	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I like to reflect and ask questions and really investigating how the pros and cons of the project so I think this side of me will be of big help in the final report when reflecting back on the project.

	3	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I feel like I led the team forward in making sure no small tasks were left behind and making sure we finish in time so that we don’t have so much left during the last sprint.
