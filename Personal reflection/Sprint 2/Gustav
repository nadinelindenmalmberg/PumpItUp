What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Further knowledge about the agile process, further knowledge in back-end development.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
During the second sprint, focus has been on getting more comfortable with javascript and web development. Ive been doing mostly front end tasks, where I created a search bar and the css along side of it. The next sprint I will be focusing on some more back end coding and help out in the mini, flex groups we have created.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have been able to apply some of my knowledge previously learned from the last sprint. It was good to have a week at the start of the project to get aquianted with the different languages and scope of the project.
