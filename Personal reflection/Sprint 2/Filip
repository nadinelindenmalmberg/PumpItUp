What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    One area where I want to improve my understanding is in testing React applications. While I have some basic knowledge 
    of testing frameworks and methodologies, I recognize that there is a lot more to learn when it comes to 
    testing in a React context.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    In terms of my contribution to the team's deliveries, I have been able to leverage my technical 
    knowledge to help troubleshoot issues and answer questions that have arisen during the sprint. 
    Additionally, I have been trying to actively engage with my team members to understand how I can 
    better support their work and help us all be more productive.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    During this second week of the sprint, I continued to focus on improving my understanding of 
    agile processes and React. I have been actively seeking out resources and asking questions of 
    my team members to deepen my knowledge in these areas.
