What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Further knowledge about the agile process, further knowledge about javascript and webdevelopment more specifically

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
During the second sprint, focus has been on getting more comfortable with javascript and web development. The knowledge has been focused on the legend for the bicycle app and developing this part of the program. During upcoming sprints i hope to take on new parts of the program to develop. I also hope to assist the group through valuable discussion and personal input and thought on how to proceed further. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Developed my knowledge and know the basic now. Have been able to do some more concrete tasks rather than getting to know the language and way of working
