	1	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
This week i still want to learn more about the technical aspect of the project. The best way for me to learn that is to be active in coding during the week which i also have been doing.

	2	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Next sprint i want to have better overview over the whole project. That entails both hearing more about how the others are doing during the sprint and also reminding my teammates to update our Trello board so it always is very visible how the team is doing. Up until now we have had a bad habit of moving around the board at the end of the sprint when it is time for reflection rather than during the sprint.

	3	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    I said i wanted to be better at coding and this sprint i am very proud that i managed to implement a feature that i was unsure if i was capable of doing in the beginning of the sprint. It showed me that i know more of the techincal side than i thought.
