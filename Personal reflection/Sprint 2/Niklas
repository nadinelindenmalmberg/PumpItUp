1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

Like the last sprint I would like to learn more about the technical parts of the project, which means learning more about web-development.

2.	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

During the sprint I have co-coded the code for a legend where a user can see what the different objects in the map represents. 

3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Being more involved in code that has been written.
