    What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    - I want to deepen my understanding of JavaScript, the language we're using to build our application. Specifically, I want to learn how its different components work together and gain a more comprehensive understanding. 
    What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    - This week, I have mainly been working on the back-end to contribute to the team's deliveries. Hanna and I, among other things, implemented live location on our map. 
    - During the week, our group discussed the need for better communication following a slight miscommunication. To improve communication within the team and avoid future miscommunications, I plan to summarize our decisions and clarify the details of upcoming actions/meetings, including when and where they will take place.
    Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    - I find using the agile work procedure, such as the scrum board, more helpful. However, I think we could benefit from having more detailed specifications for our user stories. Sometimes, one user story can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to confusion about which features and implementation were intended from the outset.
