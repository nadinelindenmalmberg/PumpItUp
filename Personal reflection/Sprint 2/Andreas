 What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    - I want to learn more about how to create better user stories and break them down furhter with tasks.
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    - I have worked together with Filip and we have been working on tooltip feature. We have also fixed some bugs regarding how the markers were updated. I have also tried helping my teammates with some technical quesstions.
    - I could be more active in the communication channels so that misunderstandings are avoided.
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    - Gotten a better understanding of the Google Maps API that we are using in this project.
