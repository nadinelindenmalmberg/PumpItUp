What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I think we should be able to preform better if we learn how to devide the work for the week in a better way. Take time during the planning meeting and discuss until the vision is clear for everyone.  
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Focus at the goal for each work session and use the time to be productive. 
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
The meetings were planned with good foresight, that's important.
