What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
-  Same as last week, optimize workflow and effectivity.
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Unfortunately, due to a scheduling conflict with one of our work sessions this week, I had to work on my own which was primarily on frontend tasks . To prevent similar issues in the next sprint, I suggest scheduling dedicated times for individual work and ensuring tight communication with the team to keep everyone informed of progress and problems.
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
As we near the end, there is greater clarity on the division of responsibilities within the team.
