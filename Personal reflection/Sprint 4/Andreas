1	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    I feel like I understand the scrum way of working quite good now, but of course you can always learn more.

2	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    I have worked on the autocomplete user story and error messages.

3	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    Not that much really.
