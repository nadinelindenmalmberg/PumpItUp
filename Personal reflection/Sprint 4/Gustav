What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Having gained a solid understanding of the Scrum methodology, my primary focus is now on acquiring further knowledge in JavaScript and React web development.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
The main emphasis of this sprint involved enhancing the searchbar and its autocomplete feature within a bicycle app by dedicating efforts towards its development. This was done together with alex and andreas. Next weeks sprint i want to connect the result of the autocomplete function to buttons where a user can pick from the 3 nearest stations and get driections from the adress from the input to the adress chosen. 

I also hope to assist the group through valuable discussion and personal input and thought on how to proceed further. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have expanded my expertise by successfully completing additional concrete tasks and doing so with increased efficiency. Ive improved on dividing a problem in smaller concrete tasks, making it easier to complete them.
