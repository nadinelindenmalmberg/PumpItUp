1	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I cannot really think of anything bigger that I want to learn this coming sprint. I feel like every thing I have written here has been answered int the coming sprint and I've learned what I have wanted. So nothing bigger but I am looking forward to seeing the end of this project to have been able to see the whole scrum process from start to finish.
	2	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Next week I really want to focus on finishing what I have set my name on during the planning. This means that our planning holds and I deliver what I have set out to do. This also creates room for helping with other parts if I am finished or at least in phase with my work.
	3	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
    I worked really good this past sprint which I am happy about. I think the reason this sprint stood out was because we worked in a smaller group this week which made me really be able to focus on what I was doing without getting distracted in what others were doing.
