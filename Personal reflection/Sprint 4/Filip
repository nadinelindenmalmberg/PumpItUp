What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc?
In the coming week, I want to focus on improving my understanding of the latest testing techniques and tools for React applications. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
In terms of my contribution to the team's deliveries, I continued to work on improving our testing practices. However, I've been sick and have not worked as much as the other weeks and I have trouble making progress.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Over the past week, I have continued to apply the testing concepts that I learned in the previous weeks, and have also started exploring some new tools and techniques for testing React applications.
