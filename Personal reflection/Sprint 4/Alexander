What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
Now that im rather comfortable with the scrum way of working, further knowledge about javascript and react webdevelopment is priority

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
During the fourth sprint. The work has been focused on a searchbar and its autocomplete function bicycle app and developing this part of the program. During upcoming sprints i hope to take on new parts of the program to develop. I also hope to assist the group through valuable discussion and personal input and thought on how to proceed further. 

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
Further developed my knowledge. Have been able to do some more another concrete task and did so more efficiently
