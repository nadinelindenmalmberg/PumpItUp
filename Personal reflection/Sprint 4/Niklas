1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

As every personal reflection I would like to learn more about the technologies we are using in the project. Further, how to keep a group aligned with what everyone is doing in agile processes is something that I could learn more about. 
2.	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?

During this sprint I have fixed minor issues from last weeks sprint. This week. Due to clashing schedules I could not co-locate with the group during one of our sessions so I was less updated about the project during this sprint. This should be improved for next week.
3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
I have a better understanding of the program we are building and how all the components are working. I think we as a group are more able to identify our strengths and weaknesses.
