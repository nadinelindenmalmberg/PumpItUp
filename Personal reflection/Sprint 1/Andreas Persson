I want to learn more about the agile processes and more about the technologies we use such as React, nodeJS and so on. 

I mainly contributed with development of the code. I was a part of all the user stories this sprint and tried to be helpful to my teammates when devloping. Next sprint I think I can help my team to do better by being more active in the sprint planning. I also want to try to help more with testing.
