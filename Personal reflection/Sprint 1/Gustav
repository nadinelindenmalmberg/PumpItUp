What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
The agile process, teamwork, javascript and full stack development.

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
Unfortunately ive been abscent from my team this week due to remote work. This is why my focus this week have been on trying to understand the basics of the MERN stack, and ive taken several crash courses in Javascript, Nodejs and Expresss etc. on free learning platforms.

Next sprint I will try to help with the development of the application and work with our user-stories.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
