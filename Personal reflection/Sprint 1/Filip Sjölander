What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    The agile processes. I also want to learn React better, and how we test our code. 

What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    I have contributed with my technical knowledge. I want to help my team with questions about the 
    code and how you do things, even if I don't understand it myself yet.

Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
