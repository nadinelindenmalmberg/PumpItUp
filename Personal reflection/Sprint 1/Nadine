What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
    - I would like to understand scrum and the agile process better. I however believe that it will become easier to learn and understand once we start using and working with them in practice.
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
    - My contribution for now is being involved in discussions and meetings that we have had regarding the first sprint. 
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
