1.	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 

I want to learn more about the technical parts of the project. 

2.	What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I have contributed by discussing the code and giving input to the project when we have been sitting together coding. During the next sprint I need to prepare myself by learning more about different concept to solve our tasks. For instance going through a tutorial on how to use something in our code. 

3.	Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
This is the first sprint.
