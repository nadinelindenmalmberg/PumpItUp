What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I want to understand the agile processes even more because I don't really see the positive aspects of using it right now. It's a new way of thinking so I guess it will take some time. 
What is my contribution towards the teamâ€™s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I can be more active and ask question if I don't understand another member. 
Changes/improvements from last week's reflection?
