	1	What do I want to learn or understand better? Consider e.g. teamwork, Scrum, agile processes, technologies etc? 
I would really like improve on the technical side of the project. I feel as if I have a poor understanding of how to create a project from scratch and how everything is connected within the project. Especially now that we are basing our project as a web application.

	2	What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries? How can I help my team do better next sprint?
I think I can contribute when it comes to the agile way of working and the scrum team way of thinking as I have previously touched on the subject in a previous course. I am also very eager to learn more of the technical side so therefore I think I can support my team in that sense as well. During this week I have followed a thorough tutorial on youtube on how to build a fullstack web application which a teammate in the team showed me. Our application is going to be built very similarly to this of the one in the tutorial so therefore I think this will help me understand our project even more.
